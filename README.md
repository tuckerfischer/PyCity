# Overview

In this project we analyzed school funding as well as student scores in order to provide insights and trends to assist the school district in making future decisions.

* Large schools had a lower passing percentage for both Math, and Reading scores
* Medium size schools had the highest passing percentage for Reading and the same passing percentage as Small schools in Math

* Schools that spent less than $584 had a higher passing percentage across the board compared to other high budget per student
* Schools that spent the most money on their students has the lowest overall passing percentage

Through the process is was determined that the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School were influenced by cheating and therefore had to be dropped from the Data set.

* Before dropping 9th graders Thomas High Schools overall passing percentage was in the 60's
* Math and Reading scores were both in the 60's as well

* After Dropping the 9th grade grades Thomas High Schools scores increased in to the 90's

# Conclusion

Dropping the ninth grade scores did not make a significant impact to the school district results. Further analysis should consider dropping ninth grade scores in all of the district in order to maintain a uniform data set. Dropping the ninth grade scores did bump Thomas High School from a low performing school to the top five.
